* The Lowest activity is observed between the hours of 2:00 AM to 5:00 AM. This would be the most ideal time for bike maintenance.
* The Highest activity is from 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM and would require the most supply of bikes.

## Summary

During the month of August 2019  the bike sharing service in New York shows high activity usage. 
Majority of the rides were taken by Male ussers during the morning and evening work hours which can imply that bike usage is an alternative form of transport for commuters. The high service usage by males can help us also identify our target market and help in deciding whether the male population in Des Moines will use the bike services as well. I dentifying the peak hours of usage and times during which the bikes are used can help us determine an ideal budget and time for bike maintenance hours. Additional analysis to consider for our bike business would be to analyze different months of the year and also determine how weather would affect usage.
